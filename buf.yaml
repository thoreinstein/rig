lint:
  use:
    - DEFAULT
  except:
    - PACKAGE_DIRECTORY_MATCH

deps:
  - github.com/bufbuild/reflect-workspace
  - github.com/bufbuild/buf # For buf lint and breaking change detection
  - github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate # For runtime validation (optional but good practice)

# Add a module reference for google.golang.org/protobuf
# This assumes buf will be used to manage dependencies.
# If not using buf as a module, protoc will need to find it via GOPATH or protoc's include paths.
# For simplicity, we'll assume buf handles this via its module resolution.
# If buf is installed locally and protoc is used directly, proto paths need careful configuration.
# For now, let's assume buf will be able to resolve it.
# The 'deps' above might be sufficient for buf to manage these.
# If not, we might need to add specific directories or use a 'plugins' section.
# Let's check buf documentation for best practices on Go module integration.
# For now, a minimal config.
