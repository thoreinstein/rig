# Product Guidelines: Rig

## Tone and Voice
- **Opinionated and Bold:** Rig speaks with confidence and assertiveness. It doesn't just offer options; it clearly expresses the "right way" to manage developer workflows, guiding users toward established best practices with conviction.

## Design Principles
- **Simplicity First:** We prioritize simple, obvious solutions. Rig is designed so that its defaults "just work" for the vast majority of scenarios, eliminating the need for complex, manual configuration.
- **Transparency:** Rig operates with full clarity. It explicitly communicates its actions to the user, ensuring there are no "magic" black boxes. Users should always understand what modifications are being made to their environment.

## Visual Identity (CLI)
- **Structured Formatting:** Information is organized logically using clear headers, precise indentation, and consistent bulleted lists. This structure ensures that even complex output is easy to scan and digest.
- **Semantic Color Coding:** We use color strategically to convey state. Green signifies successful completion, Red highlights critical errors that require attention, and Yellow provides important warnings or advice.

## Error Handling
- **Action-Oriented Messaging:** Error messages are brief but informative. They prioritize the "how to fix" over the "what went wrong," providing clear, actionable steps or suggestions to ensure the user can resolve the issue and continue their work immediately.
